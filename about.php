			Over the years as I've tried to do this or figure out that, small, personal blogs have often helped me in succeeding, usually because official documentation of the topic was too complex for me, outdated, or just sparse/non-existent.
			I'll find myself relying on multiple of these sources to resolve the most update to date solution that is right for my situation/platform, and I usually think I should start formalising my own findings online to return the favour.
			That's what this site is for. It's where I can formalise my findings/thoughts on things (and hopefully more in the future) and hopefully help a few people in the process.
